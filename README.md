Methodology and Tools Used
I conducted a step-by-step analysis of a sample phishing email using a multi-faceted approach to identify both social engineering tactics and technical red flags.

Email Client: Used to view the sample email and extract the raw headers for in-depth analysis.

MXToolbox Header Analyzer: A free online tool that helped parse the complex email headers to verify the sender's authenticity and trace the email's origin. This was crucial for checking authentication records like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

URL Scanner: Used to analyze the embedded links within the email to check for malicious content and confirm if the link's destination matched its appearance.


Analysis of Findings
Through this analysis, I identified several key indicators of a phishing attempt, including:

Email Spoofing: The email address impersonated a legitimate organization but used a public email domain (@gmail.com) instead of a corporate one.

Social Engineering: The email used an urgent and threatening tone to pressure the recipient into acting quickly.

Mismatched URLs: The text of the embedded link was designed to look legitimate, but the actual URL pointed to a different, non-corporate website.

Technical Discrepancies: The header analysis revealed failed authentication checks and unusual routing, which are common with spoofed emails.****
